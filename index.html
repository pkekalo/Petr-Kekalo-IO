        <p> 
            My name is Petr Kekalo originaly from Belarus, Minsk. Now living in Philadelphia, PA. 
            I am a proficient full-stack software engineer with a solid foundation in JavaScript, React.js, and various animation techniques.
            I have completed intensive training at Hack Reactor and freeCodeCamp, where I sharpened my skills in full-stack development.
            Currently, I am enrolled in Code the Dream's online bootcamp, further expanding my knowledge and expertise. 
            In addition to my formal education, I am actively working on side projects, which allow me to apply what I have learned and explore new technologies. 
            I have demonstrated my expertise through various projects, showcasing my ability to build responsive and dynamic web applications. 
            My strong grasp of JavaScript algorithms and data structures, combined with my practical experience in using modern development frameworks, makes me a valuable asset in any development team.
